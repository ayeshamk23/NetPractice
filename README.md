# 🌐 NetPractice – Intro to Networking at 42

> _“Understand networks by building and breaking them.”_

---

## 📚 Project Overview

**NetPractice** is a foundational networking project at **42 School**, completed on **05 October 2024**, designed to teach the basics of computer networking. Through a series of interactive exercises, students learn how IP addressing, subnetting, and routing logic work by solving practical network configuration problems.
